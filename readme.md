A high-performance, visually striking web calculator featuring an animated glowing aura and a sleek dark-mode aesthetic. This project demonstrates clean JavaScript logic paired with advanced CSS3 animation techniques.

✨ Features

Animated Neon Border: A dynamic, rotating glow effect built using CSS @keyframes and pseudo-elements.

Instant Calculation: Real-time evaluation of mathematical expressions.

Responsive Grid: Centered, mobile-friendly 4-column layout using CSS Grid.

Tactile Feedback: Smooth hover and active states (scaling effects) for a premium user experience.

Error Handling: Built-in validation to display "ERROR" for mathematically invalid operations.

Typography: Professional "Courier New", monospace for a technical, precise feel.

🛠️ Technical Breakdown
🧠 JavaScript Logic

The app uses a streamlined approach to handle arithmetic:

appendToDisplay(input): Appends numbers and operators to the string buffer.

calculate(): Uses the JavaScript eval() engine wrapped in a try...catch block to handle calculations and errors safely.

clearDisplay(): Resets the state for new computations
